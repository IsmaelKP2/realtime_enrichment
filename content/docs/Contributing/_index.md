There are lots of cool things to do in order to imporove this workshop!  Here are just a few things we'd love to implement:

## To Do:
- [ ] Write API/webhook for scale-up/scale-down
- [ ] Implement automatic scale-up when consumer lag is too high
- [ ] Raise Incident with OnCall
- [ ] Kafka topic selector (dashboard)
- [ ] Low: replace stub sentiment analyzer with a NLTK (or other)
- [ ] Use Terraform to build Dashboards for additional apps that are leveraging Kafka
- [ ] Allow gremlin testing
    - API to stop microservices
- [ ] Setup steps for Windows?
